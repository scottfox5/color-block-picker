##Color Picker Game

When the page is loaded, the user is alerted to select a specific block based on its color. The correct block is randomly generated.

When the user selects the correct box, they are alerted of their success, the block turns pink, and the game starts over.
If the user selects the wrong box, they are alerted that they are incorrect and told to guess again.
